# Image_Captioning_project

Caption generation is a challenging artificial intelligence problem where a textual description must be generated for a given photograph.

It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order.

This Project is divided into 6 parts; they are:

1)Photo and Caption Dataset

2)Prepare Photo Data

3)Prepare Text Data

4)Develop Deep Learning Model

5)Train With Progressive Loading (NEW)

6)Evaluate Model

7)Generate New Captions
